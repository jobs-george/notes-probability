# Axioms

The `sample` command also allows us to specify probabilities for each of the outcomes in the sample space.
For example, consider the sample space $S = \{1,2,3,4\}$, where 4 is twice as likely to be sampled than 2, and four times as likely as 1.

```{r}
sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 3, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4))
```

For sampling without replacement, 
if the outcome $1$ is sampled, 
the remaining outcome probabilities must be redistributed by solving the equation

$$
0.2k + 0.3k + 0.4k = 1
$$
The new probabilities will be proportional to the original.
