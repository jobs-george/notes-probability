The sample command also allows us to specify probabilities, e.g., 
where 4 is more likely to be sampled, 
twice as much as 2, and 4 times as likely as 1.

```{r}
sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 3, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4))
```

For sampling without replacement, 
the probabilities are redistributed by solving the equation

$$
0.2k + 0.3k + 0.4k = 1
$$

The new probabilities will be 'proportional' to the original.
