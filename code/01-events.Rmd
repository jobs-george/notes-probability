# Events

## Sampling

The `sample` command generates realizations from finite sample spaces in R

```{r}
set.seed(42)
sample(x = c("heads", "tails"), size = 7, replace = TRUE)
```

The `set.seed` command makes the realization(s) reproducible.

## Naive Probability

The `sample` command, unless specified, 
will generate *equally likely* outcomes. 
We can check this by computing the long-run frequency of the outcomes

```{r}
set.seed(42)
sample_size <- 1e5
frequencies <- table(sample(c("heads", "tails"), sample_size, TRUE))
(probabilities <- frequencies / sample_size)
```

The probability of the event "heads", $P(A_H)$, is approximated by the long-run frequency

$$
\frac{n_H}{n} = 0.503 \approx 1/2 = \frac{|A_H|}{|S|} = P(A_H)
$$

The events "tails" and "heads" are approximately equal, confirming that each outcome is equally likely.
