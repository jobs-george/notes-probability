# Counting

## Birthday Matches

Imagine a room with $k$ people. 
Assume that each personâ€™s Birthday is equally likely.  
Calculate the probability that 2 or more people have the same birthday.

## Simulation

To simulate the birthday problem, 
use the sample function to choose 23 random birthdays
b <- sample(1:365, k, replace = TRUE)
table(b)

# Then simulate n times with a set random seed
set.seed(42)
nsims <- 10^4
r <- replicate(nsims, max(table(sample(1:365, k, replace = TRUE))))
sum(r>=2) / nsims

#> 0.5072

# .Comments: 
# - randomly choose 23 numbers w/ replacement between 1 and 365 corresponding to 23 people's birthdays. 
# - tally the numbers, and check if there is at least 1 match (max >= 2)
# - do this 10k times, and count the proportion of matches
# - above half of simulations have at least 1 match

# .Calculation
# The probability of at least one birthday match in a group of 23 people
# can be calculated from a combinatorial analysis
k <- 23
p_match <- 1 - prod((365-k+1):365)/(365^k)
p_match

#> 0.5072972

# Better yet, R has a built in function
pbirthday(k)

#> 0.5072972

# Or the number of people to have a match with probability p
qbirthday(0.5)

# The function also allows triple, quadruple matches
pbirthday(23, coincident = 3)

#> 0.01441541
